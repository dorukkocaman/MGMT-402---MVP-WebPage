# ErasConnect MVP

A landing page to test if Erasmus students will engage with a peer-to-peer connection platform **without housing listings**.

## What This Is

This MVP tests our core hypothesis: Will students value connecting with other Erasmus students for advice and community, even if the platform doesn't provide housing or rental listings?

## Features

- Clear value proposition for peer-to-peer connections
- **Prominent housing disclaimer** (the key test element)
- Student matching form collecting:
  - University and destination
  - Student status (past/current/future)
  - Field of study
  - Type of help needed
  - Contact information
- Mobile-responsive design

## How to Use

1. Open `erasconnect-mvp.html` in any browser
2. Share with Erasmus students for testing
3. Monitor sign-up rates after users see the disclaimer

## Success Metrics

- ≥20% sign up after seeing disclaimer
- ≥30% engage in first week
- ≥70% find it helpful without housing features

## Built With

Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - no dependencies required.
